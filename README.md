# Logical Programming in Prolog

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the 'Introduction to Logical Programming' course at my university. It includes a series of exercises and a final project focused on building an SAT solver in Prolog. This solver takes propositional logic formulas, converts them to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), and finds all possible solutions using the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) Algorithm.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections: Exercise Sheets and Project. Each exercise sheet folder contains the problem statement (PDF), Prolog code (.pl files), and solutions. The project folder contains the SAT solver implementation and related resources.

### Exercise Sheets
- Exercise 1-11: Each folder contains problem statements, Prolog scripts for the exercises, and 
their respective solutions.
### Project
- SAT Solver: The final project, which includes the SAT solver implementation, a README with 
instructions, and various resources and benchmarks for testing the solver.

# Commit History Highlights

The following are some key commits (tag and hash) in the project's development:

- sat (21e104a): Final project completion.
- cnf (a4d9b55): Addition of CNF conversion functionality.
- norm (14dbf35): Addition of normalization functionality.
- ex_start (66b5c61) - ex_end (fceae09): Implementation of various logical programming  concepts 
  and exercises, including higher-order predicates, alpha-beta pruning proof by contradiction in FOL, list manipulation, and more.
# Installation and Usage

To use the solutions or the SAT solver:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed (e.g., SWI-Prolog).
Navigate to the desired exercise or the project folder.
Run the Prolog files using your Prolog interpreter.
